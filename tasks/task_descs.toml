**2nd Tier - 75.00** Above Average Targets & Disclosure
    - Full disclosure across Scopes 1+2 emissions.
    - Scope 3 data disclosed but possible data gaps for relevant/material Scope 3 categories. The company is likely to be in the process of filling data gaps and may have more qualitative narrative to support this in their disclosures e.g. engaging with suppliers to provide more complete and accurate emissions data.
    - Reporting aligned to TCFD. 2nd tier companies will likely be disclosing across some or all of the TCFD pillars but may be lacking detail. This could, but does not necessarily have to be, through the CDP Climate Change questionnaire.
    - Targets in place, covering scope 1 and 2 (absolute or intensity) but may exclude or not fully include relevant/material scope 3 emissions.Some detail on action plans on how targets are being met / reductions achieved, and reporting on progress against targets. May have qualitative narrative on more challenging reductions in specific business lines/activities. These activities must be active on the company’s part, and not passive to/entirely reliant on grid-based energy mix improvement.</ul></td>

**3rd Tier - 50.00** Average Targets & Disclosure
    - Full disclosure across Scopes 1+2 emissions.
    - Limited Scope 3 data disclosed and not necessarily for most relevant or material Scope 3 categories, with little ambition to fill those gaps (eg. Only disclosing Business Travel).
    - Reporting partially aligned to TCFD. 3rd tier companies will likely be disclosing TCFD headlines (e.g. may be a one-pager in Annual or Sust. Report), most likely around Climate Risk Management and Strategy. This could, but does not necessarily have to be, through the CDP Climate Change questionnaire.
    - Any form of reduction target is in place for Scope 1+2 emissions. No reduction target for Scope 3 emissions.
    High level details on plans to meet targets and/or how reductions have been achieved. Minimal evidence of supporting narrative on challenges.
    
**4th Tier - 25.00** Below Average Targets & Disclosure
    - Some disclosure of emissions but company may acknowledge data gaps. It may not be clear that the information is aligned to the GHG protocol (eg. just disclosing “Fleet Emissions”). No scope 3 data is disclosed and no intention to collect the data is clear.
    - TCFD may be cited but no disclosure across the for pillars, or reporting is under development.
    - The company has committed to setting a target that covers scope 1 and 2 emissions in the next 1-2 years.

**5th Tier - 0.00** No Targets & Disclosure
    - No emissions disclosure in place. Company may mention that data/baseline is being collected.
    - No targets are in place, and there is no clear commitment to set a target.
